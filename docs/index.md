Welcome!

I am an applied AI research scientist with expertise in measurement and evaluaition science. I come from a background in psychometrics and social/personality psychology. I am currently working on measurement in AI, where I examine human-centered applications of LLMs. For a deeper look at my areas of focus (past and present), please visit the Research page and my LinkedIn (which is updated more frequently than this website).
