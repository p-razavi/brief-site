# Pooya Razavi

Welcome!

I am a research data scientist. My expertise lies at the intersection of measurement, applied LLMs, and behavioral science. I currently leverage these skills to examine human-centered applications of LLMs. For a deeper look at my areas of focus (past and present), please visit the Research page.

My LinkedIn profile is updated more frequently than this website.
